❓❗️ Who am I? I am a Sr. Technical Account Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS), India.

With over a decade of experience in the IT industry, I’ve dedicated my career to Open Source and Cloud Computing technologies, particularly with AWS since 2014.

In my previous role as a Technical Enterprise Architect (SA) at Accenture India, I worked very closely with customers to understand their unique needs and help them modernize their applications. My focus on microservices and cloud-native architectures allowed me to guide organizations in leveraging the full potential of cloud technology.
